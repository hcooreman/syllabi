- Discussion Board: Link in Canvas Course website under the Ed Discussion link

### <span style="color:darkblue">Prerequisites</span>

CSCI200 or CSCI262 with a grade of C- or higher, or equivalent computer programming experience. This class assumes you are familiar with Boolean logic, data types, collections, set operations, binary search trees, and graphs.

### <span style="color:darkblue">Required Technology</span>

Internet connection; regular access to a reliable PC/Mac; Web browser for Canvas, WebSQL, Runescape, &amp; other online resources. You can access our course database by installing software on your PC/Mac or by remote login to isengard.mines.edu (which requires VPN or being on the campus network). I also recommend installing Canvas on your phone to get notifications. Please bring a laptop, tablet, or smart phone to class to access the course database for class activities.

### <span style="color:darkblue">Online Community and Communication</span>

Most course work is submitted on Canvas, and all grades are provided on Canvas. **Please [upload a profile picture](https://guides.instructure.com/m/4212/l/710334) similar to the type used on your blaster card, so we can all get to know each other in this online format.** 

Check Canvas for links to our discussion board platform; we use that 
for communicating with the instructor, TAs, and your classmates online. You are expected to check it at least once a day during the week for current announcements; it is used, for example, for a change of venue or lab clarifications.

## <span style="color:darkblue">Welcome to Database Management</span>

We are eager to meet you all and work with you as you learn about databases.
This semester will be available in-person. Our class model is a "flipped"
classroom with work required prior to coming to class to make class time more
interactive and effective. We will be doing hands-on activities each day, with
worksheets on most Wednesdays. Bring a laptop or tablet with a terminal tool
installed to access isengard in class.

### <span style="color:darkblue">Course Description</span>

This course is all about the construction, design, and use of databases with a peek at their inner workings. We will
primarily focus on relational (SQL) databases, and we will touch on various non-SQL DBMSs
databases at the end of the semester. A brief list of topics:

- Entity-Relationship models and database design
- Normalization of database structure
- SQL query performance
- Relational database managagement: loading data, transactions, security
- Programming applications against SQL databases
- Non-SQL DBMSs

### <span style="color:darkblue">Learning Outcomes</span>

At the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. Construct a data model using the Entity-Relationship model.
2. Design a relational database schema implementing a data model, including
tables, indexes, and constraints; analyze functional dependencies and normalize
a relational database schema.
3. Create database objects and upload data to populate a database; and issue statements to add, remove, and alter data and metadata in a database.
4. Construct retrieval and data modification queries in SQL; apply transaction control for
complex updates; tune queries for performance.
5. Build applications accessing a relational database in Python or Java.
6. Develop a security model for a database.
7. Describe a non-SQL database system's differences from RDBMSs (e.g. NoSQL, graph, vector, timeseries, NewSQL, etc.).


### <span style="color:darkblue">Textbook</span>

NOTE: we assign readings from the textbook. These will add to your understanding and may be of use in preparing for class and exams or completing labs.

- [Practical Databases](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/coloradoschoolofmines_practical_db_fall23/index.html) by Painter-Wakefield, available at Runestone (requires free account)
- additional resources listed in Canvas course material


### <span style="color:darkblue">Assessments</span>

The assessments for this course include the following:

- semi-weekly worksheets addressing the topics of the week; these are graded on effort and evidence of understanding, with solutions discussed in the following class
- participation is a quality-based grade and consists of showing active participation in class (partly accomplished by attending class), in the textbook, and on the discussion board - either asking or answering questions
- 6-8 individual labs, addressing the SQL topics covered in class
- 1 exam, showing individual attainment of SQL and relational knowledge; this will be a 1-day take-home exam that is estimated to take 2 hours to complete assuming you prepared prior to the exam by completing the labs individually and fully preparing for and participating in class and getting your questions addressed in class, on the discussion board, or during office hours.
- 2 group projects: one shows attainment of the SQL-related course outcomes, and the second shows attainment of the non-SQL course outcome; the first includes a report and a poster, the second includes an infographic. Both are presented to the class by the group.

Note that there will be a SQL presentation day during Review Week, the non-SQL project will be due at the end of Review Week, and the final exam time will instead be used for non-SQL presentations.

### <span style="color:darkblue">Grading Policy</span>

Grading will be done on an absolute, but adjustable scale. This means that there is no
curve. Anyone earning 90% or more of the total number of points available will receive
a grade of A; 80% or higher a B, etc. This scale may go down, but it will not go up.

All grades will be posted in Canvas

| Worksheets        | 15%           |
| Participation     |  5%           |
| Labs              | 30%           |
| Projects          | 40%           |
| SQL Exam          | 10%           |

Actively working on the worksheets and preparing for and participating in class will prepare you for the labs; that and the labs will prepare you for the exam and SQL project.

<!-- Do we agree with this late policy or would rather go to passes similar to data engineering? -->
### <span style="color:darkblue">Late Policy</span>

Late lab submissions are _strongly_  discouraged. As with most programming languages, the material builds on itself.
However, I understand that you are busy, and sometimes you need to work around other responsibilities. 
Accordingly, late labs will be accepted with a 10%/week (including partial weeks) penalty, up to the last day of classes in review week, unless excused absences apply. **Any requests for exceptions to this late policy must be made to the course instructor (not the TAs).**

Worksheets cannot be submitted late, as they are an ongoing activity throughout the semester with solutions provided in the next class.

The group projects cannot be submitted late due to time constraints - the SQL project requires printing of posters, and the non-SQL project similarly. Extenuating circumstances might apply, however be prepared to cover for your teammates should they be unable to participate.

Exams can only be taken late with excused absences; contact your instructor one week prior to the exam or as early as possible about the need for a make-up exam.

If you need exam accommodation, please arrange that with Testing Services one week or more _prior_ to the exam date as shown in Canvas.

### <span style="color:darkblue">Coursework Return Policy</span>

On-time worksheets, labs and exams will be graded and returned as quickly as possible,
generally within two weeks. Late homework will be graded as quickly as possible, but at
lower priority than on-time homework and exams.

If you do not understand from the feedback provided on your coursework how to improve your learning performance, please contact your instructor or the TAs. If you believe your work was graded incorrectly, please first discuss it with the grading TA. If you feel that did not resolve appropriately, then bring it to your instructor for review.

### <span style="color:darkblue">Expectations for Success</span>

- You are expected to engage in all course activities, tasks, and assignment as
  an emerging professional. The Mines Academic Integrity Policy and CS@Mines
  Collaboration Policies form a core part of your expected ethical behavior.
  Make sure you are behaving with the same level of professionalism that would
  be expected at a future full-time position. My general rule of thumb is:
  **_informal_ is acceptable, but _disrespectful_ is not**. For example, you
  can address Prof. Gabe Fierro as "Professor" or "Dr. Fierro" but do
  not address any of us as "Hey".

- Be active and physically take notes/write questions when viewing videos and participating in class; the notes provided are not comprehensive but may be useful for taking notes on.

- You are expected to be courteous during class, especially during in-class activities. This also applies if you show up early and are chatting with your classmates. Note: swearing is not considered courteous.

- In addition to actively participating during the class time each week, you are expected to spend 3-6 hours on this course each week outside of class, reading/preparing for class and completing lab and project work. Time management is a critical skill for success in this class, further studies, and professional work.

- Reliable internet and computer access are important; if your access is spotty, develop a backup plan to ensure you can complete and submit work on time.

- Canvas submissions must be completed by the Canvas due date/time; if Canvas marks it as late, then it is late. Early submission is permitted. 

- If you have an excused absence for pre-planned activities leading up to or on due dates, those due assignments *must be turned in before the due date* or the late policy will be applied. This includes sports events.

- It is your responsibility to check your submissions on Canvas and ensure the files are not corrupt and are gradable. If you turn in something that the instructor/TAs cannot open, is for a different class, or is not in the correct format, that is an automatic 0 on the assignment. I recommend checking from a different browser or computer to be sure.

- If you are absent, you are responsible for determining what work was missed and for putting forth a good faith effort to review the material. Once the material is reviewed, bring questions to the instructor and TAs as quickly as possible. The material in this class builds on itself from week to week, so staying on track and catching up quickly is important for your success.

- Be proactive and communicate your course-related concerns and needs to your instructor in a timely manner.

- No late accommodations will be made for exams or worksheets unless there is an excused absence.

- Presentations are are held in class tentatively on the dates noted in the Canvas Schedule page for this course. Make your travel plans outside these weeks.

- Use our discussion board for CSCI 403 questions outside of class. First do a quick search to see if your question has already been addressed. If not found, go ahead and post your question so that the instructor, TAs, or another student can address it. Do not post your own work that you plan to submit publicly on the discussion board, or request solutions to assignments. If you are unsure, submit it privately to the Instructors on the discussion board to share it with just the instructor and TAs. 

- Use email, a private message on the discussion board, or office hours if you wish to contact your instructor about your grade, an excused absence, or other matter not appropriate to share with the class as a whole. Your instructor will return messages within 24 hours during the school week, possibly longer on the weekends or holidays.

### <span style="color:darkblue">Collaboration Policy</span>

- Be aware and follow the university’s [code of conduct](https://catalog.mines.edu/policiesandprocedures/).

- CS@Mines takes academic integrity seriously. The penalty for violating academic integrity will be determined by the instructor on a case-by-case basis. Be aware of the [CS@Mines policy on collaboration](http://cs-courses.mines.edu/csci403/CollaborationPolicy.pdf) - individual work does not permit collaboration. We do not want to see any academic dishonesty in this class! **Seek help before this becomes a possibility for you**. Note that NO sharing of actual work/answers/code on an individual lab is permitted by the collaboration policy or this class, unless specifically stated otherwise in the assignment description. Only worksheets permit open collaboration, and group projects only within the group members.

- For CSCI 403, we also apply these collaboration items for individual work:

    - You are encouraged to discuss ideas around assignments with other students in the class, but *do not share answers or code* for any part of an individual lab. If you are concerned about correctness, come to office hours to discuss your work with a TA or the instructor.

    - If you discuss an assignment with anyone (not counting instructors/TAs), you must list their names in your submitted assignment AND provide a brief summary of the discussion, including its benefit to you/impact on your submitted work.

    - You are not allowed to give any part of an answer/code you have developed to another student NOR copy any part of an answer/code created by another person (student or otherwise). This includes material from the internet.

    - Any discussion with another person about any part of your answers/code (or theirs) is subject to the _empty hands_ policy, which means you leave the discussion without any record - electronic, mechanical or otherwise - of the discussion. If you feel you were influenced by the discussion, it should be cited.

    - Any material from any outside source, such as books, projects, from the internet, or from generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT) should be properly referenced. Such sources should not be directly quoted/used in any part of your answers or code - your work needs to be your own, to develop your problem solving and design skills.

    - If you are aware of students violating this policy, you are encouraged to inform the instructor or course coordinator.
 
    - Violating this policy will be treated as an academic misconduct for all students involved (both the provider(s) and the receiver(s) of answers). 

- **NOTE:** All issues of misconduct are reported to the Dean of Students. Academic misconduct may result in course failure for all students involved and an entry on your school record.

### <span style="color:darkblue">Mines Course Policies</span>

Mines has put in place several policies related to course management. Those policies will be applied as appropriate to this class, and may impact existing policies. See the separate documents provided on Canvas detailing those. 

- please seek help from the resources Mines provides if you are in need; it is there for you, we are here for you!

- respect your peers, TAs, and instructors - we all want to succeed at what we do, and you don't know what those around you may be dealing with outside of class

- let us know if your needs are not being met, and seek accommodation if needed

- respect the OreDigger Promise and the Mines Student Code of Conduct to support Mines' reputation as well as your own

- you should remain aware of current Mines COVID protocols and actively implement them for yourself.
