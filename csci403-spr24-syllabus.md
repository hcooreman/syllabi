- Discussion Board: Link in Canvas Course website under the Ed Discussion link

### <span style="color:darkblue">Prerequisites</span>

CSCI200 or CSCI262 with a grade of C- or higher, or equivalent computer programming experience. This class assumes you are familiar with Boolean logic, data types, collections, set operations, binary search trees, and graphs.

### <span style="color:darkblue">Required Technology</span>

Internet connection; regular access to a reliable PC/Mac; Web browser for Canvas, WebSQL, Runescape, &amp; other online resources. You can access our course database by installing software on your PC/Mac or by remote login to isengard.mines.edu (which requires VPN or being on the campus network). I also recommend installing Canvas on your phone to get notifications. Please bring a laptop, tablet, or smart phone to class to access the course database for class activities.

### <span style="color:darkblue">Online Community and Communication</span>

Most course work is submitted on Canvas, and all grades are provided on Canvas. **Please [upload a profile picture](https://guides.instructure.com/m/4212/l/710334) similar to the type used on your blaster card, so we can all get to know each other in this online format.** 

Check Canvas for links to our discussion board platform; we use that 
for communicating with the instructor, TAs, and your classmates online. You are expected to check it at least once a day during the week for current announcements; it is used, for example, for a change of venue or lab clarifications.

---

## <span style="color:darkblue">Welcome to Database Management</span>

We are eager to meet you all and work with you as you learn about databases.
This semester will be available in-person. Our class model is a "flipped"
classroom with work required prior to coming to class to make class time more
interactive and effective. We will be doing hands-on activities each day, with
worksheets on most Wednesdays. Bring a laptop or tablet with a terminal tool
installed to access isengard in class.

### <span style="color:darkblue">Course Description</span>

This course is all about the construction, design, and use of databases with a peek at their inner workings. We will
primarily focus on relational (SQL) databases, and we will touch on various non-SQL DBMSs
databases at the end of the semester. A brief list of topics:

- Entity-Relationship models and database design
- Normalization of database structure
- SQL query performance
- Relational database managagement: loading data, transactions, security
- Programming applications against SQL databases
- Non-SQL DBMSs

### <span style="color:darkblue">Learning Outcomes</span>

At the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. Construct a data model using the Entity-Relationship model.
2. Design a relational database schema implementing a data model, including
tables, indexes, and constraints; analyze functional dependencies and normalize
a relational database schema.
3. Create database objects and upload data to populate a database; and issue statements to add, remove, and alter data and metadata in a database.
4. Construct retrieval and data modification queries in SQL; apply transaction control for
complex updates; tune queries for performance.
5. Build applications accessing a relational database in Python or Java.
6. Develop a security model for a database.
7. Describe a non-SQL database system's differences from RDBMSs (e.g. NoSQL, graph, vector, timeseries, NewSQL, etc.).


### <span style="color:darkblue">Textbook</span>

NOTE: we assign readings from the textbook. These will add to your understanding and may be of use in preparing for class and exams or completing labs.

- [Practical Databases](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/Mines_CSCI403_Spring24/index.html) by Painter-Wakefield, available at Runestone (requires free account)
- additional resources listed in Canvas course material


### <span style="color:darkblue">Assessments</span>

The assessments for this course include the following:

- weekly check-in assignments addressing the topics of the week; these are graded on effort and evidence of understanding, with solutions discussed in the following class
- 6-8 individual labs, addressing the SQL topics covered in class
- 3 quizzes, showing individual attainment of SQL and relational knowledge; prepare prior to the exam by completing the labs individually and fully preparing for and participating in class and getting your questions addressed in class, on the discussion board, or during office hours.
- 2-part final project: the first is individual and shows basic attainment of the SQL-related course outcomes, and the second is a group project focusing on combining datasets and a deeper understanding of course outcomes.

Note that there will be a SQL presentation day during Review Week, the non-SQL project will be due at the end of Review Week, and the final exam time will instead be used for non-SQL presentations.

### <span style="color:darkblue">Grading Policy</span>

Grading will be done on an absolute, but adjustable scale. This means that there is no
curve. Anyone earning 90% or more of the total number of points available will receive
a grade of A; 80% or higher a B, etc. This scale may go down, but it will not go up.

All grades will be posted in Canvas

| Labs              | 30%           |
| Quizzes           | 30%           |
| Final Pre-Project | 15%           |
| Final Project     | 20%           |
| Weekly Check-Ins  | 5%            |

Actively working on the worksheets and preparing for and participating in class will prepare you for the labs; that and the labs will prepare you for the exam and SQL project. Extra credit may be offered for additional learning activities related to this class. Unless otherwise detailed in this syllabus, the awarding of extra credit is at the discretion of the instructor and is not guaranteed.

<!-- Do we agree with this late policy or would rather go to passes similar to data engineering? -->
### <span style="color:darkblue">Late Policy</span>

Late lab submissions are _strongly_  discouraged. As with most programming languages, the material builds on itself.
However, I understand that you are busy, and sometimes you need to work around other responsibilities. 
Accordingly, late labs will be accepted with a 1%/day (including partial days) penalty, up to three weeks after the due date, unless excused absences apply. **Any requests for exceptions to this late policy must be made to the course instructor (not the TAs).**

Weekly Check-Ins cannot be submitted late, as they are an ongoing activity throughout the semester with solutions provided in the next class.

The group projects cannot be submitted late due to time constraints - the SQL project requires printing of posters, and the non-SQL project similarly. Extenuating circumstances might apply, however be prepared to cover for your teammates should they be unable to participate.

Quizzes can only be taken late with excused absences; contact your instructor one week prior to the quiz or as early as possible about the need for a make-up quiz.

If you need quiz accommodations, please arrange that with Testing Services one week or more _prior_ to the exam date as shown in Canvas.

### <span style="color:darkblue">Absences</span>

Mines students are expected to fulfill their academic requirements through attendance and/or participation. Class attendance is required of all students unless the student has an excused absence granted by the school or the student’s professor. An excused absence awarded by the school or professor comes after a student's request or initiative. To review the Excused Absence Policy and/or to request an excused absence, please visit [https://www.mines.edu/student-life/student-absences/](https://www.mines.edu/student-life/student-absences/).

### <span style="color:darkblue">Coursework Return Policy</span>

On-time worksheets, labs and exams will be graded and returned as quickly as possible,
generally within two weeks. Late homework will be graded as quickly as possible, but at
lower priority than on-time homework and exams.

If you do not understand from the feedback provided on your coursework how to improve your learning performance, please contact your instructor or the TAs. If you believe your work was graded incorrectly, please first discuss it with the grading TA. If you feel that did not resolve appropriately, then bring it to your instructor for review.

---

### <span style="color:darkblue">Expectations for Success</span>

- You are expected to engage in all course activities, tasks, and assignment as
  an emerging professional. The Mines Academic Integrity Policy and CS@Mines
  Collaboration Policies form a core part of your expected ethical behavior.
  Make sure you are behaving with the same level of professionalism that would
  be expected at a future full-time position. My general rule of thumb is:
  **_informal_ is acceptable, but _disrespectful_ is not**. For example, you
  can address Prof. Gabe Fierro as "Professor" or "Dr. Fierro" but do
  not address any of us as "Hey".

- Be active and physically take notes/write questions when viewing videos and participating in class; the notes provided are not comprehensive but may be useful for taking notes on.

- You are expected to be courteous during class, especially during in-class activities. This also applies if you show up early and are chatting with your classmates. Note: swearing is not considered courteous.

- In addition to actively participating during the class time each week, you are expected to spend 3-6 hours on this course each week outside of class, reading/preparing for class and completing lab and project work. Time management is a critical skill for success in this class, further studies, and professional work.

- Reliable internet and computer access are important; if your access is spotty, develop a backup plan to ensure you can complete and submit work on time.

- Canvas submissions must be completed by the Canvas due date/time; if Canvas marks it as late, then it is late. Early submission is permitted. 

- If you have an excused absence for pre-planned activities leading up to or on due dates, those due assignments *must be turned in before the due date* or the late policy will be applied. This includes sports events.

- It is your responsibility to check your submissions on Canvas and ensure the files are not corrupt and are gradable. If you turn in something that the instructor/TAs cannot open, is for a different class, or is not in the correct format, that is an automatic 0 on the assignment. I recommend checking from a different browser or computer to be sure.

- If you are absent, you are responsible for determining what work was missed and for putting forth a good faith effort to review the material. Once the material is reviewed, bring questions to the instructor and TAs as quickly as possible. The material in this class builds on itself from week to week, so staying on track and catching up quickly is important for your success.

- Be proactive and communicate your course-related concerns and needs to your instructor in a timely manner.

- No late accommodations will be made for exams or worksheets unless there is an excused absence.

- Presentations are are held in class tentatively on the dates noted in the Canvas Schedule page for this course. Make your travel plans outside these weeks.

- Use our discussion board for CSCI 403 questions outside of class. First do a quick search to see if your question has already been addressed. If not found, go ahead and post your question so that the instructor, TAs, or another student can address it. Do not post your own work that you plan to submit publicly on the discussion board, or request solutions to assignments. If you are unsure, submit it privately to the Instructors on the discussion board to share it with just the instructor and TAs. 

- Use email, a private message on the discussion board, or office hours if you wish to contact your instructor about your grade, an excused absence, or other matter not appropriate to share with the class as a whole. Your instructor will return messages within 24 hours during the school week, possibly longer on the weekends or holidays.

### <span style="color:darkblue">Collaboration Policy</span>

- Be aware and follow the university’s [code of conduct](https://catalog.mines.edu/policiesandprocedures/).

- CS@Mines takes academic integrity seriously. The penalty for violating academic integrity will be determined by the instructor on a case-by-case basis. Be aware of the [CS@Mines policy on collaboration](http://cs-courses.mines.edu/csci403/CollaborationPolicy.pdf) - individual work does not permit collaboration. We do not want to see any academic dishonesty in this class! **Seek help before this becomes a possibility for you**. Note that NO sharing of actual work/answers/code on an individual lab is permitted by the collaboration policy or this class, unless specifically stated otherwise in the assignment description. Only worksheets permit open collaboration, and group projects only within the group members.

- For CSCI 403, we also apply these collaboration items for individual work:

    - You are encouraged to discuss ideas around assignments with other students in the class, but *do not share answers or code* for any part of an individual lab. If you are concerned about correctness, come to office hours to discuss your work with a TA or the instructor.

    - If you discuss an assignment with anyone (not counting instructors/TAs), you must list their names in your submitted assignment AND provide a brief summary of the discussion, including its benefit to you/impact on your submitted work.

    - You are not allowed to give any part of an answer/code you have developed to another student NOR copy any part of an answer/code created by another person (student or otherwise). This includes material from the internet.

    - Any discussion with another person about any part of your answers/code (or theirs) is subject to the _empty hands_ policy, which means you leave the discussion without any record - electronic, mechanical or otherwise - of the discussion. If you feel you were influenced by the discussion, it should be cited.

    - Any material from any outside source, such as books, projects, from the internet, or from generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT) should be properly referenced. Such sources should not be directly quoted/used in any part of your answers or code - your work needs to be your own, to develop your problem solving and design skills.

    - If you are aware of students violating this policy, you are encouraged to inform the instructor or course coordinator.
 
    - Violating this policy will be treated as an academic misconduct for all students involved (both the provider(s) and the receiver(s) of answers). 

- **NOTE:** All issues of misconduct are reported to the Dean of Students. Academic misconduct may result in course failure for all students involved and an entry on your school record.

### <span style="color:darkblue">Mines Course Policies</span>

Mines has put in place several policies related to course management. Those policies will be applied as appropriate to this class, and may impact existing policies. See the separate documents provided on Canvas detailing those. 

- please seek help from the resources Mines provides if you are in need; it is there for you, we are here for you!

- respect your peers, TAs, and instructors - we all want to succeed at what we do, and you don't know what those around you may be dealing with outside of class

- let us know if your needs are not being met, and seek accommodation if needed

- respect the OreDigger Promise and the Mines Student Code of Conduct to support Mines' reputation as well as your own

- you should remain aware of current Mines COVID protocols and actively implement them for yourself.


### <span style="color:darkblue">Course Schedule</span>

See the schedule page on Canvas for a tentative course schedule. This schedule is subject to change. 

Please check there regularly for any updates to the course schedule.

### <span style="color:darkblue">Sexual Misconduct, Discrimination, and Retaliation</span>

Discrimination, Harassment, and Sexual Misconduct of any type, including sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking, are prohibited under the Policy Prohibiting Sexual Misconduct, Discrimination, and Retaliation. Please see the Office for Institutional Equity website for information on Sexual Misconduct and Discrimination.

As your instructors, it is our responsibility to foster a learning environment that supports diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, honors your identities, and is free of discrimination. Please feel free to speak to us if the class is not living up to these standards. Please note that we are also  mandatory reporters as instructors at Mines, and if we receive a disclosure of Discrimination, Harassment, and/or Sexual Misconduct, we are required to report it to the Title IX Coordinator.


### <span style="color:darkblue">Preferred First Name Project</span>

Mines recognizes members of the campus community may prefer to use a first name other than their legal name to identify themselves. Many services on campus, like Canvas, utilize and display preferred first names. Additional information on preferred name, including how to update your preferred name, is available at the [Office For Institutional Equity website](https://www.mines.edu/oie/preferred-first-name/).

### <span style="color:darkblue">Academic Integrity</span>

Colorado School of Mines affirms the principle that all individuals associated with the Mines academic community have a responsibility for establishing, maintaining, and fostering an understanding and appreciation for academic integrity. In broad terms, this implies protecting the environment of mutual trust within which scholarly exchange occurs, supporting the ability of the faculty to fairly and effectively evaluate every student’s academic achievements, and giving credence to the university’s educational mission, its scholarly objectives, and the substance of the degrees it awards. We desire an environment free of any and all forms of academic misconduct and expects students to act with integrity at all times. Please read the [full academic misconduct/integrity policy](https://www.mines.edu/policy-library/academic-integrity-policy/) for full definitions of academic misconduct. Additionally, please use [resources provided by the Office of Community Standards](https://www.mines.edu/student-life/community-standards/academic-integrity/) for guidance should you need to know more about the procedures of the policy for academic misconduct/integrity.

### <span style="color:darkblue">Generative Artificial Intelligence</span>

By submitting work for evaluation in this course, you represent it as your own intellectual product. Submitting content for evaluation (e.g., ideas, text, code, images) that was generated, in whole or in part, by Generative Artificial Intelligence tools (including, but not limited to, ChatGPT, Bard, and other large language models) would be considered Academic Misconduct in violation of Mines Academic Integrity/Misconduct Policy unless granted permission to do so. We will explain to you the specific uses of genAI tools that are permitted or prohibited in this course, including on what specific assignments use of genAI tools is permitted.

AI is an extremely powerful tool and, as the next generation of computer scientists and software engineers, you should know how to use it to enhance your mastery of this course. Here are the acceptable ways to use AI in this course with examples.

| Use | Example Prompt | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Using AI to explain a query or a concept from class | “What does the query ‘SELECT * FROM <table_name> WHERE <attribute> EQUALS <value>’ do? Explain each aspect of the query”  | You can change the way AI explains a concept to you based on prompt engineering. This can encourage and help you learn if you’re struggling with the way your professor is explaining the material. |
| Asking for examples of a specific concept | “How would you create an ERD using a one-to-many relationship?” | You must think through a concept to ask AI to explain it to you. By thinking of different ways to ask the AI to give you examples, you kind of have to know what to ask. |
| Asking for examples of queries to achieve a particular result | “What key elements would I have to have in a query to join two tables inclusively?” | Similar to the concept idea, you have to know what the end goal of the query is to effectively ask this question. |

What you are NOT allowed to do is ask for solutions for labs. Please don’t enter information about the tables used in labs and then ask questions. Can AI do this? Yes. But how is that going to help you master the material of this course?  OpenAI also reserves the right to use the information given to it to feed the model. Please don’t give out course information like that – then professors must change the course material and it’s just a disaster all around.

If you have any questions or need clarification, please come to Office Hours, and the TAs, Hayden, or CPW will go over the policy with you! 

### <span style="color:darkblue">Disability Support Services</span>

Disability Support Services (DSS) works collaboratively with students, faculty, and staff to minimize barriers and support an accessible campus community. When barriers to access occur, Disability Support Services works one-on-one with students to determine accommodations and facilitate access to programs and services. If you've been approved for accommodations through Disability Support Services, please contact your professor to confirm receipt of your accommodation letter and to discuss the implementation of accommodations in this course. Please visit [mines.edu/disability-support-services](mines.edu/disability-support-services) for more information or to request accommodations. 

### <span style="color:darkblue">Digital Accessibility</span>

The Colorado School of Mines is committed to supporting an accessible digital environment for all members of our community, including students with disabilities. If you have an accessibility concern with Canvas or any digital materials or software used in this course, please contact your professor or request support from Information & Technology Solutions. Please visit [https://www.mines.edu/accessibility/](https://www.mines.edu/accessibility/) for more information.

### <span style="color:darkblue">Student Outreach & Support (SOS) Resources</span>

If you feel overwhelmed, anxious, depressed, distressed, mentally or physically unhealthy, or concerned about your wellbeing overall, there are resources both on- and off-campus available to you. If you need assistance, please ask for help from a trusted faculty or staff member, fellow student, or submit a referral for yours. As a community of care, we can help one another get through difficult times. If you are concerned for another student, offer assistance and/or ask for help on their behalf. Students seeking resources for themselves or others should visit [mines.edu/sos](mines.edu/sos). 

Student Outreach and Support can help connect you with a variety of resources; some of those might include:

In an emergency, you should call 911, and they will dispatch a Mines or Golden PD officer to assist.

### <span style="color:darkblue">Diversity and Inclusion</span>

At Colorado School of Mines, we understand that a diverse and inclusive learning environment inspires creativity and innovation, which are essential to the engineering process. We also know that in order to address current and emerging national and global challenges, it is important to learn with and from people who have different backgrounds, thoughts, and experiences.

Our students represent every state in the nation and more than 90 countries around the world, and we continue to make progress in the areas of diversity and inclusion by providing [Diversity and Inclusion programs and services](https://www.mines.edu/about/diversity-and-inclusion/) to support these efforts.

### <span style="color:darkblue">Course Issues and Concerns</span>

As part of good professional practice, students are encouraged to speak with the faculty directly to raise issues and concerns with regards to the course professionally in compliance with the student code of conduct. Students can also reach out to the course coordinator (Christopher Painter-Wakefield) or the Computer Science Department Head (Iris Bahar). The department head can investigate and work with the faculty member to resolve course-related concerns. Students’ final point of contact is the Dean of Energy and Materials Programs (John Berger) who can make any final decisions.

### <span style="color:darkblue">Maintenance Clause</span>

This syllabus is intended to give students guidance on this course this semester and will be followed as closely as possible. The instructor reserves the right to modify, supplement and make changes as the course needs arise. This syllabus is not a legal document; common sense rules always apply, e.g., no late assignments will be accepted after the solutions are discussed or available.
